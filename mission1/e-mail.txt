Hello

Hope all is well? We have a situation here where we could use your assistance.
A packet trace has been discovered and it looks like the communications between these lover are being sent in plain txt 
between the chat clients. Yet we are still unable to determine the Application being used or the full transcript of the 
communications. Even though it is only 18 packets in total. Could you please determine what both sides of these communications
are saying for us? We need this evidence in a divorce settlement that proves the individual in question is having an affair.

Regards
Melony
