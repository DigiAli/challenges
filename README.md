# Challenges
This directory contains a set of security/crypto challenges for the purposes of forensic analysis.

It is my recommendation that if you are inexperienced in these sorts of challenges or do not have a thorough understanding of the inner workings of Linux systems that you start on something easier. Much easier! These challenges would put a lot of strain on even the most seasoned and experienced forensic analysts, crypto experts and security professionals! 

Drop me an e-mail if you manage to solve any of them I would really like to hear from you.
