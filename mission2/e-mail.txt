Good Day

Just a quick question for you. Before Daniel left the office for holiday. He sent me the binary for the Non Nuclear Electro Magnetic
weapons Guidance System he is developing for our client. As you may well already know it is our company policy that we always verify the 
hashes 
to insure they have not been tampered with in transit for things with this type of security clearance. However we have a problem. We can not 
match the hash with the one retrieved on the server and I have tried everything I know to verify the binary. Perhaps I am not using the right 
hash verification method??? Could you let me know what hash function I must use to verify things coming from the Weapons Systems R&D 
Department?
