Good Day

Just a quick question for you. Before Daniel left the office for holiday. He sent me the binary for the Guidance System he was writing for use with Non Nuclear Electro Magnetic Pulse Weapons. As you may well already know it is our company policy that we always verify the hashes to insure they have not been tampered with in transit for things with this type of security clearance. However we have a problem. We can not match the hash with the one retrieved on the server and I have tried everything I know to verify the binary. Perhaps I am not using the right hash verification method??? Please advise and could you let me know what hash function I must use to verify things coming from the Weapons Systems R&D Department?

Regards
Marillyn
